# Preface {.unnumbered}

Solving the problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) using R, Julia and Python.

This is intended to be an exercise on algorithms and optimization, and, of course, to show how fast Julia is :D

The Julia solutions are written by [G. Vituri](https://github.com/vituri); the Python ones are written by [William](https://github.com/william-lima-p); and the R ones by [Laura](https://github.com/rinoscronauta) and the rest of my team.
